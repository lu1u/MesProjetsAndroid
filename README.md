Some of my android projets:

Compagnon du motard (aka Biker's compagnon)
Application that helps you when you're riding your motorcycle and cannot (or don't want to) use your hands. 
Uses speech synthetisis to: 
- say the hour (every 15 minutes, configurable) 
- warn your if you go too fast 
- warn you if you are riding for too long without a break 
- warn you when you're gaz tank is half empty 
- read your incoming SMS 
- says the caller name when you receive a phone call
